                     Patch File 1.3 - 11 December 1998
                               Patch Version 1.02d

-----------
(1.0) Patch
-----------
The patch will invalidate saved games from version 1.0. To transfer
your character from 1.0 to the final patch version use the save
game character transfer utility found on the Fallout 2 Web Page in
the Files section.
www.Interplay.com/Fallout2

If you have saved game from a previous patch, the Final patch IS 
compatible with those saved games. The Beta patch was just that, a
Beta, so if you were having problems with your saved games with the
Beta patch, we recommend that you completely start over.

Be sure to check (1.4) README CHANGES for a list of modified sections
of your NEW readme.txt.


(1.1) PATCH INSTALLATION
------------------------
This is the Patch for the 1.0 *US* Version only. The US version is
also sold in many other countries: Germany, Australia, France, etc.
If it's the English version from the US, as opposed to the UK or
foreign language version, then this is the proper patch for it.

The patch is self extracting. Simply copy it to your system and run
the patch.exe from any directory.

It will ask you for the path that you originally installed
Fallout 2 to unzip the patch files to. The path when installing the
patch will default to the original Fallout 2 installation default
directory. If you installed in somewhere else, change the directory
to the appropriate path.

After the F2patch.exe uncompresses, there is nothing else that needs
to be done. Do not delete the patch000.dat or any other file that it
created.

If you get a "Can not find/load text fonts" error message, then you
it could be one of three things:

1. Your Fallout2.cfg file has been modified and is no longer
referencing the Master.dat and the Critter.dat as being in the
correct place. These two files should be in the main folder where
you installed Fallout 2. Change the path in the Fallout2.cfg to
reflect the proper path for these files. 

2. You need to have the CD in CD Rom drive. Even if you have a huge
install, try inserting the CD.

3. Your Fallout2.exe or Readme.txt might have become read only. Right
click on each of them and select properties. Check the attributes
section to be sure that Read Only does NOT have a check mark next to
it.

-Loading and Saving of Save Games have been sped up, for other ways
to improve load times check the trouble shooting section of the

 longer, so you will be able to talk to them all the time.

-Ghouls in Gecko will not randomly shoot at you.

-Harold will give you the right information when you are trying to
 optimize the power plant.

-Shopkeepers will get money more often - this is more of a tweak
 then a bug fix.

NEW FIXES TO THE 1.02d PATCH: Again this is NOT a complete list, but a list
of the more commonly asked about problems.

-Fixed T-Ray not taking money for getting car back

-Fixed Stuart Little boxing so that he only gives you one chance to repeat.

-Also, he wasn't setting the names properly for the STUPID character, this
should be fixed.

-All boxing problems have been addressed. Critical failures count as a
knockdown, this is not going to be changed.

-Fixed Valerie where to go when done upgrading weapons.

-Fixed Slim Picket not taking/checking for money for the Outdoorsman Skill
upgrade. Also, there should be no way to get him to give you the upgrade more
than once, code put in as a safety.

-When Vegeir was sending you home with Jonny, he was trying to send the car
with you too. I found out this is bad and the car isn't set up to do so. He no
longer touches your car in this situation.

-Car should be compatible with patch, it also will fix some of the car
problems that might occur if the car doesn't show up in correct spots.

-In related news, the trunk should be working better in conjunction with the
car as the code is all new since we shipped and now knows where the car is at
all times.

-One of the Engine bugs we fixed will fix the problem of the trunk showing up
without the car, since the trunk script was becoming "junked"(to speak
technically).

-The car leaves with you when you leave random encounter maps, but only if the
car is on that map and it has fuel. Before, if you used the out of gas car, it
-would keep following you around, this is fixed.

-Slavers die and now STAY DEAD when killed by the slaves you are hunting!
Amazing, bastards just didn't want to go down easily.

-Get Car part quest should be clearing now.

-Fixed the leaving maps with party member crash. This could potentially fix
lots and lots of thing out there since it was killing memory at this
point(this is what helps fix the cars).

-Miria should no longer follow after she is dead.

-Fixed party members going up levels with Power Armor bug.

-Fixed Tyler door bug where he would sometimes give you permission to use the
door, but would attack you if you tried to use the door.

-Fixed Joey not taking money for Jet.

-Fixed problem with when the player comes out the back entrance of the
raiders(secret entrance) and the car not being there.

-Fixed Saving game on "Holy Knights" encounter do that you can finish the
whole thing even after saving.

-No longer pre-maturely ends "Murder" quest when you tell Mr. Wright that his
son was poisoned.

-Fixed inability to use the dresser in New Reno map 2 where Mrs. Bishop is.

-Cody gives you exp now when he leads you to the chop shop.

-Mason will let you use the door if he tells you it's O.K.

-Myron now takes all the stuff to make drugs even if it's in his inventory. So
if you tell him you want to make 3 radscorpion antidotes and switch the tails
to his inventory, he'll delete them from his inventory as well.

-There no longer is any way to get $2000 from Dr. Troy for selling him jet.

-Fixed "offcier" spelling to "officer" with Randal.

-Fixed it so you can't get stuck on level 4 by entering from the world map
before the player extracts the organ. This fix is simply due to the fact that
you should only be able to enter Sierra Army Depot from the ground floor from
the town map.

-You now get xp for giving the non-working brainbot a brain.

-Buster now replenishes his supplies more often.

-Cannot enter any map but the entrance map from the town map.

-Player can complete the spleen seed even if he is a Hubologist.

-Talking Bette out of fighting should set the "Stop-the-bar-brawl" quest to
complete.

-Fixed bug with saving during lopan/dragon fights.

-Made it so there is only the Battle Field area to enter the Sierra Army Depot

-Changed it so that Melchior only lets 4 of his pets out at once. This should
reduce pathing problems with multi-hex critters.

-You now get 1000 experience for getting Brian more power for his AC.

-Fixed error with using the bulletin board during combat.

-Fixed kids not being able to be pushed when they're not on their home tile.

-Fixed problem with sometimes ending a fight and becoming stuck inside the
ring.

-Fixed bug causing some Melchior crashes related to fire geckos not being able
to hit their target.

-Fixed craps dealer bug allowing setting odds bet to 0 dollars in order to
take odds money back.

-Fixed problem with party members dying on map exits, causing Miria or any
party member dying in the toilet explosion and then following you around the
game forever.


(1.3) NOT BUGS
--------------
Here's a list of things that have been mistaken as bugs.

-If you have stuff disappearing out of your Inventory and the last
 time you had it was in the Den - then the kids in the Den probably
 stole it. They then go sell it to one of the shopkeepers.

-One of the kids in the Den does have a Frag Grenade.

-You need to get a Special Perk to be able to Skin Geckos, you can
 not just do it. You'll find the quest in the first few areas of the
 game.

-Jet is currently a permanent addiction that you can get rid of by
 solving a certain quest.

-The way ammo weight is determined is a little weird, so it will
 look like (in certain circumstances) that when you load your weapon
 you will gain weight. It should only be about 1kg, and the error
 does not accumulate.

-To refuel the car you need to use a Small Energy Cell or Micro
 Fusion Pack from your inventory (not your hands) on the car. See the
 Manual Errata section (3.6) below for details.

-Extremely long range weapons are supposed to have negative numbers
 if you are close to your target. The negative will increase the
 closer you get. This negative number is just a representation of how
 far below zero you are to hitting your target.

-Here and now: This perk is supposed to be available at level 3. See
 section (3.3) of the readme.txt.


(1.4) README CHANGES
